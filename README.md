### 🔬 What I learned

This project allowed me to improve my web development skills by focusing on creating a functional and responsive profile design. I worked with semantic HTML5 markup to enhance accessibility and structure while using CSS custom properties to maintain a consistent design system. Flexbox and CSS Grid were key tools for building a flexible and structured layout, and I followed a mobile-first workflow to ensure responsiveness across different devices.  

I also applied the BEM methodology to organize CSS classes efficiently. One of the most significant challenges was working without access to Figma files, relying entirely on provided images. This experience sharpened my ability to interpret designs, pay close attention to detail, and adapt creatively to constraints while maintaining usability and visual consistency.
